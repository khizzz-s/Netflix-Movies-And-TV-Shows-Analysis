## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Netflixâ€™s movies and TV shows dataset using SQL (PostgreSQL).\
The goal is to extract meaningful insights and answer key business questions by querying and transforming the dataset.

## Objectives

- Analyze the distribution of content types (Movies vs TV Shows)
- Identify the most common ratings by content type
- List and explore content based on release year, countries, and duration
- Categorize and analyze content using keywords and specific criteria

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Netflix Movies and TV Shows Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download)
- Contains \~8807 records and 12 columns

## Table Schema

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS netflix;
CREATE TABLE netflix (
    show_id      VARCHAR(5),
    type         VARCHAR(10),
    title        VARCHAR(250),
    director     VARCHAR(550),
    casts        VARCHAR(1050),

## Business Questions & Solutions

Below are 15 key business questions explored using SQL, along with brief objectives and queries.

```sql
SELECT type, COUNT(*) as total_content
FROM netflix
GROUP BY type;
```

---

### 2. Find the Most Common Rating for Movies and TV Shows

**Objective:** Identify most frequent rating for each type.

```sql
WITH cte AS (
	SELECT type, rating, COUNT(rating) AS cnt,
	       RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY type ORDER BY COUNT(rating) DESC) AS rn
	FROM netflix
	GROUP BY type, rating
)
SELECT type, rating as most_common_rating
FROM cte
WHERE rn = 1;
```

---

### 3. List All Movies Released in a Specific Year (e.g., 2020)

FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie' AND release_year = 2020;
```

---

### 4. Find the Top 5 Countries with the Most Content

**Objective:** Identify top 5 countries producing Netflix content.

**Method 1: Using STRING\_TO\_ARRAY and UNNEST**

```sql
SELECT TRIM(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country, ','))) as country,
       COUNT(show_id) as total_content
FROM netflix
GROUP BY TRIM(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country, ',')))
ORDER BY total_content DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Method 2: Using REGEXP\_SPLIT\_TO\_TABLE**

```sql
SELECT TRIM(REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE(country, ',')) as country,
       COUNT(show_id) as total_content
FROM netflix
GROUP BY TRIM(REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE(country, ','))
ORDER BY total_content DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

---

### 5. Identify the Longest Movie

**Objective:** Find movie with longest duration.

**Method 1: Using SPLIT\_PART**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
	SELECT DISTINCT title as movie,
	       SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1)::numeric as duration
	FROM netflix
	WHERE type = 'Movie'
) subquery
WHERE duration = (SELECT MAX(SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1)::numeric) FROM netflix);
```

**Method 2: Using SUBSTRING**

```sql
SELECT title as movie, duration
FROM (
	SELECT title,
	       CAST(SUBSTRING(duration, 1, POSITION(' ' in LTRIM(duration)) - 1) AS INT) as duration,
	       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY CAST(SUBSTRING(duration, 1, POSITION(' ' in LTRIM(duration)) - 1) AS INT) DESC) as rn
	FROM netflix
	WHERE type = 'Movie' AND duration IS NOT NULL
) t
WHERE rn = 1;
```

	FROM netflix
) t
GROUP BY genre;
